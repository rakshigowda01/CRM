  # Fix RLS policies for students table

  1. Security Updates
    - Drop existing restrictive policies that are causing access issues
    - Create new policies that allow proper read/write access for authenticated users
    - Allow anon role to read students for public access scenarios
    - Allow authenticated users full CRUD operations on students table

  2. Policy Changes
    - Remove overly restrictive policies that check uid() = id (incorrect logic)
    - Add policies that allow authenticated users to manage student data
    - Add policy for anon role to read student data (for public dashboards)
    - Ensure proper access control based on user roles

  3. Important Notes
    - These policies enable the CRM functionality to work properly
    - Authenticated users can perform all operations on student records
    - Anon role has read-only access for dashboard views
